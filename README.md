## Build Change (again)!!

I realized recently that I should just add the lib/coreutil.jar back to repository so that you no longer have to build it yourself.  Sorry about the on-going flip-flopping about that.  I still down-compiled that jar to java 8 so that you should be able to use it regardless of which compiler you use locally.

NOTE:  I still haven't gotten ahold of a windows machine to create, change or test windows versions of some of the scripts.  All of my development has been done on Kubuntu.

NOTE 2: The v1.6 release has a number of updates in the javadoc, but I haven't gotten to making similar changes to the wiki so refer to the javadocs first.


## Now we return to the original programming...

First, thank you for stopping to look at this project!  This landing page has been completely stripped down and most of the project information has been moved to the wiki tab above.

If you have questions, comments or problems, please email me.

I would be particularly interested in discussing internationalization (foreign language support) if anyone needs changes for that.


## Note for existing users!

If you have version 1.3 or earlier and you want to get new code, you must read the RELEASE file!  Later versions might break your templates in a various ways and they are explained there.
