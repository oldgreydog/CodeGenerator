First, thank you for stopping to look at this project!  This landing page has been completely stripped down and most of the project information has been moved to the wiki tab above.

If you have questions, comments or problems, please email me.

I would be particularly interested in discussing internationalization (foreign language support) if anyone needs changes for that.


## Note for existing users!

If you have version 1.3 or earlier and you want to get new code, you must read the RELEASE file!  Later versions might break your templates in a various ways and they are explained there.
