First, thank you for stopping to look at this project!  This landing page has been completely stripped down and most of the project information has been moved to the wiki tab above.

I would be particularly interested in discussing internationalization (foreign language support) if anyone needs changes for that.


## Note for existing users!

If you have version 1.3 or earlier, you must read the RELEASE file if you are going to get 1.4!  That version might break your templates in a few different ways and they are explained there.
