# This script only builds the code and creates the codegenerator.jar file in the lib directory.

# NOTE!! This used to be set up such that it required you to get the CoreUtils repository to complete this build.
#        That is no longer the case, hense the commented-out lines below.  I added the coreutil.jar file back to
#        this project to eliminate the need for the CoreUtils repository but I've just commented-out the lines
#        instead of removing them incase you want to go back to the other way of building the project.

# Remove any existing jars so that we get a clean build.
rm lib/code_generator.jar
#rm lib/coreutil.jar
#
#
## Build CoreUtils
#pushd ../CoreUtils
#
#source java_build clean
#source java_build

#popd

#
## Copy the coreutil jar into this project so it will build.
#mkdir lib
#cp -pL  ../CoreUtils/lib/*.* ./lib


# Build the code generator java code.
source java_build clean
