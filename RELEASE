1.4

	This release has a few changes, some of which will potentially break existing templates.

		a) Added the OuterContext tags:
			- outerContext
			- outerContextEval
		b) The outerContext tags required changes to the tag attribute parser and forEach tag.
		c) Moved the initialization of the DataTypeManager from the executable's config file to a new tag:
			- typeConvertLoadFile
		d) Global config value references now require the prefix "root.".
			- i.e. an old global value reference such as <%global.outputPath%> needs to be changed to <%root.global.outputPath%>
		e) Counters now can be given optional names so that they can be referenced inside nested forEach loops. This affects the following tags:
			- counter
			- --counter
			- forEach
			- first
		f) Improved release zip file.


	a) The outer context tags are such special-case tags that you may never find a use for them.  I have a certain type of
		relationship between database tables that I define in my config value files and I wanted to use that relationship info
		to generate deletions in my cached DAO's.  But to do that, I needed to be able to jump a forEach to a node ABOVE the current
		one the template was pointing at in the config values tree.  And I needed to be able to reference values from both contexts in the
		template code inside the forEach that was pointed outside the parent forEach.  That's where the outer context tags come in.

		There are two tags.  The first is "outerContext".  This one is used to basically set a virtual maker in the loops to grab the
		node context wherever it is placed in the template.

		The second tag is "outerContextEval".  This one is used inside the inner forEach loop(s) so that you can access a value that's
		in the outer node context held by the "OuterContext" tag.

		To take advantage of this new functionality, the forEach tag's "node" attribute can now take the parent reference characters ("^")
		in its value.  Here's an abbreviated example of the usage of these tags (the 1., 2., 3. and 4. are for reference in the explanation below):


		< At this point in the template, we are inside a <%foreach node = "table" %> tag, so the current
			node context is pointing to a particular "table" node >

			<%outerContext contextname = "parentTable" %>

		.1		<%foreach node = "^table"  optionalCounterName = "innerTable" %>

		.2			<%foreach node = column %>

						<%foreach node = foreignKey %>

		.3					<%if <%and <%parentTableName%> = <%outerContextEval contextname = "parentTable" targetvalue = sqlName %>
										<%not <%parentTableName%> = <%^^sqlName%> %> == true %> == true %>

								<%text%>...<%endtext%>

							<%endif%>

						<%endfor%>

					<%endfor%>

					<%foreach node = tableRelationship %>

						<%if <%and <%parentTableName%> = <%outerContextEval contextname = "parentTable" targetvalue = sqlName %>
									<%not <%parentTableName%> = <%^sqlName%> %> == true %> == true %>

		.4					<%first  optionalCounterName = "innerTable" %>

								<%text%>...<%endtext%>

							<%endfirst%>

								<%text%>...<%endtext%>

						<%endif%>

					<%endfor%>

				<%endfor%>

			<%endcontext%>

		Once the outerContext tag is hit, you can then jump the node pointer to a different context with a forEach as shown at 1.
		Since that forEach's node attribute value is "^table", that tells the forEach to jump up ("^") one parent (which is the "root"
		node in my database config values file) and start iterating over the "table" nodes under that parent.

		!!It is super important to note that now that we are inside the new parent context at 1., all node and value references inside
		that forEach (i.e. 2.) are in that context, so you don't have to use the "^" with them!!

		3. shows how to use outerContextEval to access a value in the outer context from inside the new inner context.

		This example also shows one possible usage (4.) of the "optionalCounterName" discussed in e).


	b) The outer context tags required that I make the tag attribute parser a little more flexible.  The down side is that it potentially
		breaks existing templates a little.  Any tags attributes that have tags in their values are now required to have double quotes around
		them.  For example, this tag was fine before:

		<%file template=ddl.template filename=<%root.global.databaseName%>.ddl destDir=<%root.global.outputPath%>/ddl %>

		It now has to have quotes:

		<%file template=ddl.template filename="<%root.global.databaseName%>.ddl" destDir="<%root.global.outputPath%>/ddl" %>

		Note that the "template" attribute doesn't have an embedded tag in its value so that value doesn't have to have quotes.

		The other change was in the forEach tag.  Its "node" attribute value now allows you to use the parent reference character: "^"
		As explained for line 1. in section a) above, this is how you jump the context out to a parent level.


	c) I was never happy with the way I originally set up the DataTypeManager initialization.  I decided to fix that, so now there is a
		typeConvertLoadFile tag to do the job.  Most of the time, you'll put this tag in the root template file since most, if not all,
		of the file templates in that set will use the same type conversion config file.  But you can put the tag in any individual
		template file if only that file needs that type conversion (although technically, the tag only needs to be used once and any
		template file that happens to get executed after the tag can use that conversion).

	e) Until now, the counter mechanism was always sort of hidden under the forEach block.  Each new forEach creates a new counter for
		its context and passes that in the Evaluate() of its child templates.  If you were in a nested forEach, then you couldn't access
		the counter in any of the outer contexts, but by adding the "optionalCounterName" attribute to the relevant tags, you can now
		name the counter for one or more of the forEach blocks and then access it even in nested forEach loops.


	f) I really have to apologize for not doing a better job with the release zip file(s) originally.  I didn't provide a runnable
		environment that you could use right out of the box.  I think I have corrected that.  Now the code_generator.zip can be
		extracted in folder and you can use the generate/generate.cmd batch files (one for Linux, the other for Windows) to run the
		generator.  I included the examples in that zip file, but the javadocs are still separate.




1.3

	The big change for this release was that I removed the code for the config manager and logging that are used in the
	code generator.  I thought about it for a long time and I just didn't think that anyone would ever care about that code.
