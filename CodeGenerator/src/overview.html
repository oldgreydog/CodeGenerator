	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p>I built this code generator because I couldn't find anything that would generate whatever code
	I wanted the way that I wanted.  Even now, more than ten years later, most of the generators
	you will find are only able to output very specific files for very specific uses.  This generator,
	on the other hand, should be thought more as text generator than just a code generator.</p>

	<p>It might be best to start with the work flow of the generator.</p>

	<img src="Figure_1.svg" alt="Code Generator Overview" style="width:300px;height:300px;">

	<p>It takes two inputs: a "root" template file and a matching config values file that contains the
	values to be substituted into the template(s).  The root template file will contain one or more
	output tags, probably in one or more <code>foreach</code> blocks.</p>

	<p>At the moment, there is only one output type tag: <code>file</code>.  While I have not yet needed
	any other outputs, it is possible to write new ones that output to other targets.  I guess one easy
	example (but I'll deny it if you tell anyone I said this) would be generating email to a network
	address.  As with every other possible use for this generator, the only limitation is your imagination.</p>

	<p>In fact, that's why I'm putting this out into the ether.  I'm really hoping people will come up
	with interesting things to do with this.  Of course, given the massive haystack that Github
	has grown into, I'll be amazed if anyone even finds this.  If you've gotten this far, thank you!</p>

	<p>I have a few ideas to get you started, but we need to talk a little more about how the generator works.</p>



	<h3>Config Value Files</h3>

	<p>The config values file holds the values that are substituted into the template when the template
	is evaluated.  It is an XML file with a very simple tree structure that lets you create as complex a
	definition of your functional domain as you need.  Here is an example taken from the {@link codegenerator.generator.tags.ConfigVariable}
	documentation:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Node name="root"&gt;
	&lt;Node name="global"&gt;
		&lt;Value name="databaseName"&gt;Operations&lt;/Value&gt;
		&lt;Value name="packageName"&gt;codegenerator.examples.operations&lt;/Value&gt;
		&lt;Value name="outputPath"&gt;/home/dev/temp/code_generator/operations_db&lt;/Value&gt;
	&lt;/Node&gt;
	&lt;Node name="table"&gt;
		&lt;Value name="className"&gt;User&lt;/Value&gt;
		&lt;Value name="sqlName"&gt;USER&lt;/Value&gt;
		&lt;Node name="column"&gt;
			&lt;Value name="name"&gt;UserId&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="sqlName"&gt;USER_ID&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="memberName"&gt;userId&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="type"&gt;int&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="isNullable"&gt;false&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="isPrimaryKey"&gt;true&lt;/Value&gt;
		&lt;/Node&gt;
		&lt;Node name="column"&gt;
			&lt;Value name="name"&gt;LoginName&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="sqlName"&gt;LOGIN_NAME&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="memberName"&gt;loginName&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="type"&gt;varchar&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="valueMaxSize"&gt;50&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="isNullable"&gt;false&lt;/Value&gt;
			&lt;Value name="isPrimaryKey"&gt;false&lt;/Value&gt;
		&lt;/Node&gt;

		...

	&lt;/Node&gt;

	...

&lt;/Node&gt;
</code></pre>


	<p>This XML format comes from the ConfigManager in CoreUtils.  The <code>&lt;Node&gt;</code>s can hold
	<code>&lt;Node&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;Value&gt;</code>s.  The <code>&lt;Value&gt;</code>s only
	contain a string value.  Both tags have a required "name" attribute and an optional "description"
	attribute.  You can make your config file as simple or complex as your templates require with this
	structure.</p>

	<p>If you can agree on a config values file structure with other people, then you can each create
	template sets that can generate solutions in different languages and/or tool sets.  For example,
	if you used the database-oriented example above, then you could combine templates from multiple
	sources to generate database access code for every language used in your project.  Any database
	definition changes that you make in the config file or changes to the templates can be almost
	instantly updated across the whole code base.  Even if that is thousands of files.</p>

	<p>And since this generator isn't limited to code, you can generate any other text files that
	you need, too.  For example, the example templates have a template that will generate a DDL file
	at the same time as the database access code.</p>

	<p>And you aren't limited to database code.  You could set up config value files and templates to
	generate web pages, GUI apps or project files.  Or whatever.</p>



	<h3>Template Files</h3>

	<p>Template files are the hairier part of this equation.  As you can see from the examples, they can
	be pretty hard to decipher on the first look (or fifth for that matter).  But they don't have to start
	that way.</p>

	<p>All of my templates started off as hand-coded files that I wound up copying and altering at least
	two or three times to make other instances (database access classes being a perfect example).  By
	that point, I had tweaked and fixed enough that I had a reliable pattern that I could be confident
	that I wanted to templatize.  Then I could make a new copy and start adding template tags, at each
	step running a generation to compare to the originals.  That lets you build up the complexity
	instead of trying to create the template from scratch.</p>

	<p>While the example templates are going to be your best resource for seeing how to use the various
	tags, I've tried to give some useful documentaion for them in the <code>CodeGenerator/doc</code>
	javadocs.  But there may be things I've missed or should reemphasize so I'll cover some of the
	ones that come to mind here.</p>

	<p>Probably the most important one is the one <i>required</i> element for a template: the header
	record.  Here's the one in all of the examples:</p>

	<pre><code>%%HEADER%% openingDelimiter=&lt;% closingDelimiter=%&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>Every tag needs an opening and closing delimiter so that the parser can separate them from
	other text in the template.  But since one my major goals for this generator was that it not be
	language specific, I had to have a way to specify delimiters that might need to be different for
	each language that a template might be written for. (The other major goal was that it had to
	generate pretty code.) And it couldn't be limited to just one character each, or even two, because
	different characters or character sequences might be part of the target language so you have to
	be able to choose delimiters that won't ever be in valid code.  And the opening and closing
	delimiters don't even have to be like each other in any way if you don't want, or if there are
	conflicts with the language.  The header record lets you tell the parser what delimiters to
	look for in the rest of the template.</p>

	<h4>Tag Usage</h4>

	<p>The flow control tags can be used anywhere, including nested inside other flow control tags
	(or themselves, for that matter). For a more in-depth look at each of the tags, please refer to
	the javadocs. Here are examples of the flow control tags:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;%foreach node=column%&gt;
...
&lt;%endfor%&gt;</code></pre>

	<br>
	Note: any number of <code>elseif</code> tags can be used inside an <code>if</code> tag.
	<pre><code>&lt;%if  &lt;%type%&gt; = Integer %&gt;
...
&lt;%elseif  &lt;%type%&gt; = Long %&gt;
...
&lt;%else%&gt;
...
&lt;%endif%&gt;</code></pre>

	<br>
	<code>first</code> blocks can technically be nested inside themselves, but it wouldn't make
	any sense to do so.
	<pre><code>&lt;%first%&gt;
...
&lt;%else%&gt;
...
&lt;%endfirst%&gt;</code></pre>


	<br>
	<p>The <code>text</code> tag is special.  You can have text inside or outside of flow control
	blocks, but you <i>can not</i> have flow control blocks inside a <code>text</code> tag.  A
	<code>text</code> tag can have anything from a single character in it up to any number of lines.
	There are also certain special tags that can appear inside a <code>text</code> tag.  Here's the
	<code>text</code> tag:</p>

	<pre><code><%text%>
...
<%endtext%></code></pre>

	<br>Here are the tags that be inside a <code>text</code> block.  Note that the one common aspect of
	all of these tags is that none of them have closing tags like the flow control tags.

	<p>The config variable is a unique tag type because it looks like all the other tags because
	it uses the opening and closing delimiters, but the name inside the delimiters is the name of a
	value from the config values file.  That also means that the other tag names are reserved and
	cannot be used as config value names.  Here's an example:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;%className%&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>These are the other tags that can appear inside a <code>text</code> block:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;%customCode key=LoadAll&lt;%className%&gt;CacheCode commentCharacters=// %&gt;</code></pre>

	<pre><code>&lt;%firstLetterToLowerCase member = &lt;%className%&gt; %&gt;</code></pre>

	<pre><code>&lt;%tabMarker%&gt;</code></pre>

	<pre><code>&lt;%tabStop stopType = "stop" offset = "40" %&gt;</code></pre>

	<pre><code>&lt;%typeConvert targetLanguage = "java" sourceType = &lt;%type%&gt; groupID = "builtin" %&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>Note that, as you can see in the examples, since the config variable and <code>typeConvert</code> tags
	(and technically the <code>firstLetterToLowerCase</code> tag) evaluate to strings, they can be
	used in the values of other tag's attributes (usually the <code>if</code>/<code>elseif</code> tags).</p>

	<p>There are two tags left.  The first is the <code>tabSettings</code> tag.  If a template uses
	either <code>tabMarker</code> or <code>tabStop</code>, then you have to have a <code>tabSettings</code>
	that appears first to define the tab length and whether the tabs will be output as spaces or tabs.
	Here is an example:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;%tabSettings tabLength = "4" outputType = "tabs" %&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>And the last tag is the decrement counter tag.  It looks like this:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;%--counter%&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>This is a special tag to use inconjuction with a <code>first</code> block inside a <code>foreach</code>
	block.  There will be times when you need to build a delimited list of values (such as a parameter
	list), but one or more of the first items in the list may need to be skipped.  When that happens,
	you need to use the <code>--counter</code> tag to bump the loop counter back one each time you skip
	so that when you do get to the first item you want to add to the list, then the <code>first</code>
	block will work correctly.</p>



	<h4>Custom Code Blocks</h4>

	<p>Custom code blocks let you designate spots in the output where users can enter custom code that
	will be protected the next time the generator is run on top of those files. Here again is the tag
	example from above:</p>

	<pre><code>&lt;%customCode key=LoadAll&lt;%className%&gt;CacheCode commentCharacters=// %&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>The <code>commentCharacters</code> attribute lets you specify the single-line comment symble(s)
	that are appropriate for the language being generated.  The <code>key</code> attribute is the
	critical one to get right though.  When you run the generator on top of existing files, it parses
	each existing file that it finds before it generates on top of it to see if it has custom code in
	it.  Each time it finds a custom code block, it uses the key to store the text found in that block
	in a map.  When the generator is then generating the new version of the file, each time a
	<code>customCode</code> handler is evaluated, it builds the key and then uses it to search in the
	map of custom code pulled from the old file.  If it finds it, then it inserts that custom code
	back into the new file.</p>

	<p><b>!!!NOTE!!!</b> Generated files are not in any way "holy", untouchable objects.  You can change
	any part of them, custom code block or not.  <i>However</i>, if you change code outside a custom
	code block, you can <i>never</i> regenerate on top of them again.  If you do, you will blow away
	those changes.  For this reason, I have always generated to a location separate from my project
	tree and then used BeyondCompare to merge the changes into the project.  If you also merge any
	custom code blocks back to the generation tree, then the only differences you have to merge around
	are the new ones from the new generation and the customized code in the project.  While that simplifies
	the merge as much as possible, having to merge still makes things more of a pain in the rear. But
	if you customize outside of custom code blocks, then it's your only option.</p>



	<h3>Building and Sample Execution</h3>

	The command line build only requires a JDK (I've been using 1.8.0-102) and ant.  I've also include the project and classpath files for Eclipse.

	<p>I've included an ant build file in the root directory.  I've also created script files in the
	examples that will generate each version of the examples. Since linux and windows have slightly
	different command lines, I've had to create two different versions of the scripts.  For linux,
	run:</p>

	<pre><code>./dev_build
cd Examples/codegenerator
./generate_all
</code></pre>

	<p><b>NOTE!</b> All of these scripts have a JAVA_HOME environment variable definition line in them
	so that if you are using a JDK other than the default JDK installed on your machine, then you can
	uncomment that line in each and set it to the path for your desired JDK.</p>

	<p>The windows versions of the scripts just add ".cmd" on the names (well, they also have semicolons
	in the -cp list instead of colons used on linux):</p>

	<pre><code>dev_build.cmd
cd Examples/codegenerator
generate_all.cmd
</code></pre>
